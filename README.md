### Grid Resizing

The game allows for resizing the grid of bricks. You can render a grid of up to 20 x 10 bricks, providing flexibility in level design and gameplay experiences.

### Collision Sound

During collisions between the ball and bricks or other objects, a sound effect is played. You can choose from a variety of sound options to customize the auditory experience of the game.

### Volume Controls

The project includes options to adjust the volume of both the music and sound effects. You can lower or increase the volume levels according to your preference, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.

### Backend

To run the full version of the game, a backend is required. The backend provides additional functionality and supports features such as level creation, user profiles, and score tracking. Instructions for setting up the backend will be provided separately.

### Level Editor

The project includes a level editor that allows you to create and customize your own levels. The level editor provides a user-friendly interface to design unique levels with different brick arrangements, challenges, and buff placements. It empowers you to unleash your creativity and share your custom levels with others.
